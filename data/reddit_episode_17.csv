Ahahaha pls if it’s the latter that’s so insanely random

Sharn’s comment in the recent episode about Izzy leaving while someone like Alex who can barely hold a conversation is still in the villa completely threw me off. And Yanna basically saying it’s weird for the new bombshells to still be there? Please. The OG girls this season seriously need to be humbled. Sharn can go home next, please and thank you!"

1p4n4j6,(S7) No offence but Lacey is the most inconsistent person ever 😭,Ok_Gear4043,1763905634.0,2025-11-24 00:47:14,15,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1p4n4j6/s7_no_offence_but_lacey_is_the_most_inconsistent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1p4n4j6/s7_no_offence_but_lacey_is_the_most_inconsistent/,"In episode 5 when she’s talking to Kye, she goes “we have this thing and it’s called titty tingles”

Then the next episode shes talking to Kye again and she’s like “we call it: my right tit is always right”

AND THEN another ep she says “we have this thing where my tits talk to me.”

So which one is it babe?? Tingling?? Talking?? Fortune-telling???
Pick a personality 😩

Honestly this might be a reach, but she just REALLY pmo…"
