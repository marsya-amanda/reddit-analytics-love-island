1p42hqu,Izzy and Connor - is Isabelle toxic??,Defiant-Armadillo985,1763841156.0,2025-11-23 06:52:36,54,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1p42hqu/izzy_and_connor_is_isabelle_toxic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1p42hqu/izzy_and_connor_is_isabelle_toxic/,"So let me just say - I love them as a couple. The past few episodes I’m kinda sensing she is kind of aggressive and controlling?? Is it just me??
I feel like she’s one that loves hard and I get that BUT is it almost toxic??

What do you guys think?"

She probably just thought it was a funny saying. But I loved that she laughed at it in front of Gabby since those who seen the episodes know what happened.

She just wants all the guys' attention, lies to people, and is pretty bad to the other girls. She's a Hannah 2.0, and I am tired of hearing her tits talk 🙄 Hope the show stops focusing on her soon 😤"

That would’ve been crazy cause that’s probably what would’ve happened if they didn’t have a strong connection.

Thankfully they could stay and couple up. Their connection seems genuine and I feel like they are into each other a lot, esp Tamara— she is def into him. I don’t think their heads will turn. I think they’re the strongest couple right now.

They’re  my winners for sure!

Like I can’t with Sharn &amp; Isabel, I really can’t. It’s irritating how they are acting &amp; being so rude to the bombshells. Ugh even gabi getting mad &amp; crying about Mia talking to “her man” like did you not do the exact same thing when jotham &amp; Lacey were coupled up ?  "

However, after seeing today’s episode, I think that the OG girls are being extremely rude. I get Boston isn’t liked by Sharn. That being said, the comments they made towards Mia and Boston at the fire pit was horrible. Especially when Ross picked Boston up and everyone went quiet while Sharn said “ew”. I honestly feel that it would be very easy to give these girls a bad edit since they’re bombshells and tend to be villainised."
