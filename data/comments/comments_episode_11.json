Her casually gnawing on his finger... come on, that's some adorable crushing right there.Gabby and Jotham: I was so excited seeing them get to go to the Hideaway. I don't know if these two have long term legs, but they like each other and are having fun, I'm for it.Tamera and Mick: she's into Mateo, and thinks Mick is too jokey. Fair enough.Izzy and Conner: I don't care about either of them individually, and the two of them as a couple create a dull paste I'm even less interested in.Lacey and Kye: they are both awful. The shower? They're adults, they are in a couple, they are on a dating show, why does anyone care at all?Yana and Mateo: she will look lovely as a bridesmaid at Mateo and Tamara's wedding.",

Sharn has had barely any screen time and I think that would have impacted a public vote for her. And I think Gabby is seen as quite immature (I don't think it's fair I just think that's how she's seen based on what I see on this sub) so I think she definitely would have been up there for a public vote too.

For me, they stuck to that rule and now they are both islanders. As islanders they can go after whoever they want.They seem like a good match as of Ep 11. I'll be curious to see them spend some more time together to see what's there. It has potential at least.",

The directive Sophie gave the boys was \"who is the least likely to find love in the villa\", and using that criteria honestly I would say Yana would need to go.However, Jotham and Ross both agreed that they don't know if \"finding love\" is something that Lacey is even trying to do. Which is a fair argument given how she has moved in the Villa.AND, I just dislike Lacey and want her to get sent home. It would be a fitting end to her journey to get voted out over Yana.",
