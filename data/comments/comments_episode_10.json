She's just entertaining.Launa is also really, not smart.  I think her decision to save Kai was half still being in love and half not understanding she could just friendship ole boy.  She says hurting 2 rather than 1, but it's actually 2 counting her and it was her choice.  Just a kind of dumb choice.Ross seemed like a good guy, like him.Kai is an ass.  Gtfo",
