Once they were in the hideaway, she even asked him if he liked her lingerie and he ignored her. Antics like this are hilarious and shocking in the moment, but when you're in a relationship like this, even if you're laughing at the comedy (and truly finding it funny), it leaves you begging for scraps of attention and affirmation and feeling really empty inside.Edited to be less \"diagnostic\" in my term used to describe Kye.",
