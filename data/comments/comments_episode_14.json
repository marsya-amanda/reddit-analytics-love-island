Mia saying “I know some of you girls are couple up and cute, but today I’m gonna kiss your man!” That wasn’t funny or flirty, it sounded like she couldn’t wait to see the drama unfold as she makes out with taken people. Some girls can pick up on vibes straight away and maybe that’s why they feel so uncomfortable.Maybe if the girls were nice and friendly in the beginning, instead of saying two-faced shit and then trying to whine and say “why aren’t the girls nice to me” they wouldn’t be treated like pariahs. If y’all were in the outside and saying shit like that who would actually want to be your friend?I get girl group dynamics are lowkey hierarchy’s and most time they single out the weakest link or “fresh meat” but in this instance I think it’s justified especially when they may lowkey threaten some of the more stable relationships in the villa.",
