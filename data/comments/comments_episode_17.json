She should be happy that Connor is leaving with her, but she just wanted clout and followers and brand deals so Connor coming with her is more of her entitlement.

I do think we’re seeing a more controlling side of Izzy but I also think her being upset about Mick’s actions/comments are valid…but she is unfairly putting the burden on Connor.)Gabby at Jotham for s*xtalk\n(I also see both sides of this but don’t think Gaby handled it in the most mature way. I don’t think jotham was doing anything wrong, especially if him and Gaby have never set that boundary. That being said, she’s allowed to be upset about it but it’s unfair to expect jotham to just know that she wouldn’t be okay with that kind of conversation with other girls if they never talked about it before.)ALSO Ross saying to mick “your intentions can be gold but if it makes someone feel a certain type of way, why don’t you acknowledge that?” was a top profound comment ever made on this show.",
