He was literally trying to dictate how Lacey was spending her time and forcing her to talk to him saying it’s my turn like he’s a toddler whose toys been taken away?Also very sick of the Lacey drama, and I want to see more of the happy couples spending time together like Conner and isabel, this is LOVE ISLAND not Lacey drama island.Also feel very bad for Yana having her ex in there, the way she started shaking when he walked in there’s no way he isn’t a scary person, also why Tf does he keep doing shit with his tongue and walking around like he has something up his ass",
