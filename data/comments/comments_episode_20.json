It’s small but a fun look behind the curtain.Shoutout to the announcer with the “for all of you heathens out there just wanting to watch and see the world burn, wait for it you’ll get your chance.” I feel seen.There’s a lot of bomb dropping analogies that get used but Emma and Jaide weren’t bombshells, they were supersonic, micro-targeted smart bombs. They threw a horned up, confident and aggressive blonde at Kye and a cute brunette who gave off “mature” vibes to validate Jotham with real good talk. Even if they weren’t planning on folding, them boys didn’t stand a chance.Emma, fireball. Considering what we know (that the bombs have some idea of what’s gone/going on in the house) I’d want to think she knew how the OGs (and Gabby) treated bombshells coming in, and decided to go in with her chest out and head fixed forward, “yeah I had him, we would’ve done more if I ALLOWED IT, Cuddles were MAD!” She’s not going to be ganged on or intimidated by mean girls, so best way to handle bullies is to walk through them. Props on it. I believe it was Sharn who let out a “biiittcch” and I don’t think that was a compliment.Gabby- when Jotham dropped “not emotionally mature” when speed dating Mia and Boston, I sided with her. Her reaction at Jaide though put me firmly in with Ross and co telling her that wasn’t the way to go about it. I get she’s 21 and at that age that’s the reaction you give, right or wrong. But between this and what (assumed) we’ll see movie night about her being “flirty” aren’t a good look.",

If you Google the power and control wheel it's a great tool. The more updated versions are a lot better. Basically, we've watched him gaslight, minimize/deny then blame (with cheating), extreme jealousy etc. The most alarming sign to me was the monitoring her social media during their relationship then using that as an excuse to cheat on her and shifting the blame onto her. Iwas also very alarmed when he interrupted the conversation lacey was having. I even caught him try to force her to come. I also want to be very clear that most abusers start with emotional, financial, etc before moving to physical abuse. We shouldn't take these signs lightly bc when these tactics no longer work to maintain power and control they will very likely turn to physical abuse. The first time an abuser gets physical results in serious injury or death about 40/45% of the time. Unfortunately, society doesn't care until it becomes physical and that is too late. Men like him shouldn't have a platform quite frankly.",
