That's why it can be a hard decision because by the looks of things Jaide is considerably more mature than Gabby - which is something he's drawn to. He said he usually dates older women so that says a lot i think. So he’s shared 1.5 weeks with Gabby and appreciates certain things about her, then he meets Jaide who seems to edge her out in maturity, and likely the discussion department too.",
