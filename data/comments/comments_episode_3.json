Yikes writing this out I'm realising I'm seeing lots of criticising of the women and far less of the men. I reckon this sub is mostly a female fan-base so it's sad we're tearing each other down (fully acknowledging I have been judgemental about the playing dumb multiple times).Edit: Oh and Cooper for bad vibesAnd Isabel's trump followingAnd Mick again for creepy vibes",

And he has never been racist to you.Its just the life we live in. I am not saying it's good or bad but that's the reality other people live in. To put it in context, we have people here who think Hitler was a hero.
