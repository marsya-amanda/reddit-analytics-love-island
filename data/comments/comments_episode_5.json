But this season feels so open ended.For example: Lacey and Jotham not really knowing where they stand but also not having a conversation about it to nip it in the bud. On top of that, Lacy having her little side quest with Cooper but also being in to new guy kye.Yana and Cooper just kind of stopped pursuing things once she was chosen and haven’t really had a convo. And if it was, it wasn’t shown. But cooper is still brought up with Yana in relation to Kye and their similarities. She seems to talk about cooper often still.I think I kind of like it. Ik it’s like episode 5 but I like how they’re all just kinda vibing and exploring. It’s just very different to other seasons or the UK one where it’s very much ultimatum is given if someone is between two people.",
