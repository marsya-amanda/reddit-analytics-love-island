Boundaries are one thing, but drawing lines about who you can look at, sit beside of, or talk to, especially in a setting designed specifically for mingling and matchmaking is WILD.-I really like how Ross conducts himself. I think he's been super respectful of both women and seems to be acting with the genuine intention of finding the right match.",
