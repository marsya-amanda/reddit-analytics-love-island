We only have episode 4 out here!I have so many thoughts.1 I’m so sad about Zach, I thought he had such a great personality and it should have been Cooper, he’s cringe2 on that note, I travelled Aus for 2 months a couple years ago and Cooper is the typical aussie dude, so cocky, arrogant, not that funny, and also not that good looking hahaha like he has no banter and I think that if you’re gonna be a douche bag, at least be funny3 Isabel, she is was my fav as I think she’s super mature and grown, but learning she’s a trumpy is a huge let down4 I do notttt believe Conor only has 10 notches hahaha, I think he’s unproblematic so far but I just don’t believe that5 as a fellow Canadian I loved Bailey, but I think her crash out was not valid as it was day 2. I think she’s stunning but I think she dug her grave with that, she can’t handle the reality of love island6 Lacey is ditzy but I kinda love her, she reminds me of me and my friends when we were TWENTY. Key word twenty, a lot of people have words for her but she’s so young.7 I think Sharn is naturally beautiful but I kind of hate her tough girl persona.
