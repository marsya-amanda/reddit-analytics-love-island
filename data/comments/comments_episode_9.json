      "body": "I don't like Cooper, think he's a docuhe, but I absolutely abhor seeing bad behavior get rewarded and Yana has done it twice with her ex. First, the making out with him just validated a lot of his shitty behavior, it's such a toxic ego feed and it pissed me off. Then she goes and saves his ass. Guys like that won't see it as this amazing gesture; it will just give him more reason to think she's a doormat he can fuck over time and time again. I hate seeing that kind of attitude get positive reinforcement and she's getting on my nerves. I hope dude gets booted anyway somehow.",
