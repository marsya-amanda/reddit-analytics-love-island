No different from a really tall girl or a heavy set girl or a girl with a big booty. Or just someone incredibly beautiful. Its not just exclusive to huge boobs which Gabby has and definitely flaunts because there’s positives to it also. So because you may have been insecure about yours some of us love and use ours to the fullest. I only feel for those with extreme back pain lol",
