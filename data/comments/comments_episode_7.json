You’ve come into his with your own relationship baggage and see what you want to see, devoid of any actual evidence of it. She’s 21…logic dictates that it is extremely unlikely that it was even remotely close to a longterm relationship. She’s alleged no abuse of any kind.

Whatever you’ve made up and/or imagined in your own mind doesn’t count lol.",
