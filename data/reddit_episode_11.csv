1ov369f,Yana lip stain?,HotIntroduction9963,1762948561.0,2025-11-12 22:56:01,47,16,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ov369f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1ov369f/yana_lip_stain/,Hey guys. Does anyone know what lip stain yana used in episode 9! Such a pretty colour. It looked like in the video it went on green/silver and then she wiped it off and it was red. I know they’re sponsored by rimmel but I don’t think it’s from that. Attached pics that I could get. (Also posted in makeup aus)
