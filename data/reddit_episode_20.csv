Love Island is supposed to be about finding a connection, and even though I am really only it for the drama, I absolutely hate it when couples are punished for getting along early, and being strong. 

Every season, the safe ""boring"" couples piss the fans off and people want them broken up. To me, if someone finds their person early, nothing wrong with it, they should hae a shot to win, not every coupling in life i"

1p7nozq,How many more bombshells do y’all think there will be?,Caldel1992,1764201764.0,2025-11-27 11:02:44,8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1p7nozq/how_many_more_bombshells_do_yall_think_there_will/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1p7nozq/how_many_more_bombshells_do_yall_think_there_will/,"Do y’all think there will be more bombshells this season? I’m hoping we get a final guy and girl- which I could maybe see happening if movie night is Monday AND if two islanders are dumped in that same episode. 

If we don’t get any bombshells by Tuesday’s episode though, I doubt there will be more BUT I really feel like two final LETHAL bombshells are necessary, especially with so many available current islanders who clearly want to explore. It’ll be tragic if Bailey was the final guy 💀
