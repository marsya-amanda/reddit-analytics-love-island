1ox6hqw,Lacey love,TeachingLow2494,1763149579.0,2025-11-15 06:46:19,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1ox6hqw/lacey_love/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1ox6hqw/lacey_love/,I love Lacey. I don’t want her to go but I feel that is happening based off of episode 11 (I’m in USA I only get episodes later on Hulu) I know she is ditsy and indecisive but she’s on love island ! And it’s still early days it’s normal to not know who you want to be with yet! All I know if she does leave I hope they bring her back later on! 
1owmjt5,Mick is hilarious,The_CW9261,1763093215.0,2025-11-14 15:06:55,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1owmjt5/mick_is_hilarious/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1owmjt5/mick_is_hilarious/,I’m on episode 9 right now and watching him sprint up the stairs after he set up the picnic so Lacey could surprise Kye made me cackle so loud. He’s such a weirdo but in a very charming way. I rarely actually like any of the men (mostly tolerate the okay ones) but Mick is winning me over!

It’s the same thing over and over with every person in the villa, guys AND girls. She just wants the spotlight and 100% of everyone’s attention. I’m so bored of how much air time is dedicated to her and this little game she plays on repeat. I feel like half the episodes are her in the beach hut just yammering about absolutely nothing. The producers have lost the plot if they think viewers are interested in her antics. "
