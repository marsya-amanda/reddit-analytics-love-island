1p63nyy,(haven’t watched ep 18 yet) but..,kaysluvrsssss,1764046467.0,2025-11-25 15:54:27,13,9,https://i.redd.it/m0bgg97u3c3g1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandAus/comments/1p63nyy/havent_watched_ep_18_yet_but/,this season is getting more n more producer influenced every episode like u can’t tell me that the producers didn’t tell the new girls who to pick.. they knew it wld upset yana n gabby n cause more drama in the villa now that they are getting semi comfortable w Mia n Boston since Izzy left. Also they shld stop adding back ppl that were already in the villa LITERALLY last szn. so frustrating like obvi it’s not always a “happily ever after” on this show always but still so annoying??
